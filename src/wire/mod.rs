/*! Low-level packet access and construction.

The `wire` module deals with the packet *representation*. It provides functions to extract
fields from sequences of octets, and to insert fields into sequences of octets. This
happens through the `Packet` family of structures, e.g. [EthernetFrame] or [Ipv4Packet].

[EthernetFrame]: struct.EthernetFrame.html
[Ipv4Packet]: struct.Ipv4Packet.html

The functions in the `wire` module are designed for use together with `-Cpanic=abort`.

The `Packet` family of data structures guarantees that, if the `Packet::check_len()` method
returned `Ok(())`, then no accessor or setter method will panic; however, the guarantee
provided by `Packet::check_len()` may no longer hold after changing certain fields,
which are listed in the documentation for the specific packet.

The `Packet::new_checked` method is a shorthand for a combination of `Packet::new_unchecked`
and `Packet::check_len`.
When parsing untrusted input, it is *necessary* to use `Packet::new_checked()`;
so long as the buffer is not modified, no accessor will fail.
When emitting output, though, it is *incorrect* to use `Packet::new_checked()`;
the length check is likely to succeed on a zeroed buffer, but fail on a buffer
filled with data from a previous packet, such as when reusing buffers, resulting
in nondeterministic panics with some network devices but not others.
The buffer length for emission is not calculated by the `Packet` layer.
